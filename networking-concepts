>public ip address that are accessed over the internet.

>There are two types of public ip address
1. public ip (ipv4)
2. private ip (ipv4)

>Engineers developed NAT and private ip due to increase of public ip.

>NAT>> Network Address Transmitter

>NAT is used in routers to translates set of ip-address to another set of ip-address


>public ip address are publicly registered on the internet.
must have a public ip address to go on the internet


>private ip address are not publicly registered. So, you can not access the internet with private ip.
used internally home or business.

>taking public ip for every device is expensive. So our router will assign an private ip to the devices

>Our device trying to access the internet then our private ip address will be translated by NAT to public ip address.

>NAT translates :
private ip to public ip
public ip to private ip



>Subnet : It defines the set of local network area range.

>Any network device potentially needs any three things:
1. IP address
2. subnet
3. Gateway (ip address of router and gateway is the same thing.)
